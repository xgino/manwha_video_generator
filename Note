


issue with none text bubbles like sound on background or effects of user moments 

dificult if a textbubble is split between images 

if it shows some text inside a map on the image, it will try to read it.


voice is not human enough. 

maybe just the naroreader only no per character? 

Sometimes missing text.
includes some weird characters.

on finished sentence like like tha-- get not read so we need to clean it up more? 


... is meaning give it a silent moment,
