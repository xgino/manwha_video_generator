dificult if a textbubble is split between images 

if it shows some text inside a map on the image, it will try to read it.


voice is not human enough. 

maybe just the naroreader only no per character? 

Sometimes missing text.
includes some weird characters.

on finished sentence like like tha-- get not read so we need to clean it up more?

New note ===


Audio doenst know where we are on scroll, so if it is longer than x we mismatch the reading and scrolling.
Alternative is to get image on the scroll base on that gen the audio and others to match whats on screen.

for now it works for TBATE


, 'Image too large: (540, 45722 Error, if no images all squeezed together as one image


What if we cut the image into pieces for us? normalize input image size?
